HEK stands for human embrionic kidney cells as that is where the cell line was derived. They are used in part because of their reliable growth in culture and for their propensity for transfection. HEK-293 cells are often utilized to produce therapeutic proteins and viruses for gene therapy.

# Lentivirus
{.text-center}

Recombinant lentiviral vectors are powerful tools for gene transfer with some advantages over other delivery vectors: Besides cells that undergo mitosis, they also have the ability to transduce non-dividing cells. Further, lentiviruses enable stable gene transfer in vitro and in vivo, as they integrate into the host cell genome and offer the possibility of positive cell selection. They have a broad host cell range that also includes cell types such as primary neurons, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Moreover, lentiviral vectors have also proven to be effective in transducing brain, liver, muscle, and retina in vivo without toxicity or immune responses. Biosafety level S2 is needed for lentiviral transduction.

      <h2>Lentiviral Transduction</h2>
      <p>Lentiviruses—a subclass of retroviruses—have the ability to permanently integrate into the genome of the host cell. After the virus has entered the cell, the viral RNA is transcribed by the reverse transcriptase to produce double-stranded DNA that enters the nucleus. Finally, the transgene is integrated into the host genome via the lentiviral integrase enzymes. When using lentiviral transduction, the user has to take into account effects caused by genomic integration.</p>
